CliffiesDecor
=============

This is my testing/messaround mod for 1.6, it adds lots of crazy decoration blocks and stuff.

It also (if you have my fork of clay soldiers) will add 8 new colors of Clay Soldiers to your game.  Sweet.

Some credit to the Lantern mod I used a long time ago for the basic idea of how to make my boats light up the area around them.
